# Real World App Header and Banner parts

This repository contains just the Header and Banner parts of Richard Feldmans [Real World App](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example).

It is part of a [blog post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scaling-elm-views-with-master-view-types/) talking about using Master Page Types in Elm.

You can compare it to the ["after refactoring" repository](https://github.com/ceddlyburge/elm-master-view-types) to get a feel for the benefits.
